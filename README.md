## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Accelerating the Sales of Urban Edge Apparel

Urban Edge Apparel (an anonymized real-world company) is a premier wholesale fashion apparel manufacturer, offering a wide range of clothing items including t-shirts, jackets, pants, caps, and more. Since 2013, they have successfully processed over 11,000 wholesale orders for a diverse global clientele.

The company experienced initial growth from 2013 to 2018 but faced significant declines from 2018 to 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there was a rebound from 2020 to 2022, sales and order numbers declined again from 2022 to 2024. 

The company needs to understand these trends and identify key factors influencing customer purchasing behavior, seasonality in product sales, changes in product order quantities, trends in basket size, and geographical sales distribution. This analysis will help Urban Edge Apparel develop effective strategies to optimize sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve market competitiveness.
